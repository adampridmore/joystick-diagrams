# Templates
Define templates in SVG. Name of template should match your Joystick Gremlin device name.

# Default Templates

## Virpil
These are iniital releases, and may require tweaking. Virpil are highly customisable and as such "Button_1" for one person may be "Button_2" for another

**Thanks to MartinCo for help with the templates**
- Virpil MT50-CM2 Stick
- Virpil MT50-CM2 Throttle
- Virpil Constellation Alpha-R

## Thrustmaster
These should work out of the box with no customisation needed
- Warthog HOTAS
- Warthog Throttle

## Missing your stick?

### Adding/Modifying Templates
There are many joysticks out there, and a template needs to be provided for them in /Templates.

This is very easy to do, for free online

1. Go to an SVG compliant editor (http://draw.io/) and open CustomTemplate.SVG
2. Create a joystick profile by importing a joystick image, and creating labels
3. Call the label BUTTON_X, where X is the actual physical button on your stick
4. Export template as SVG
5. Place this in /Templates with the exact device name seen by windows

If you have created a template, happy to include it back in the repository.
